# Notes API (Rails 8 + JSON API)

This is a simple Ruby on Rails API that allows users to create and retrieve notes. It's designed to work with a React frontend, and supports live Markdown previews via the frontend.

This project contains both the backend API (notes_api/) and the frontend React app (notes_frontend/) in a single monorepo-style setup. This was done for convenience during the build phase, allowing for fast iteration and tight integration between the two layers.

If I had more time, I would separate the backend and frontend into their own standalone repositories or folders, each with their own deployment and configuration structure â€” as you would in a production-grade project. That setup would allow:

Independent CI/CD pipelines

Better separation of concerns

More realistic deployment environments (e.g. Dockerized backend, static frontend hosting)

Easier scalability and collaboration
